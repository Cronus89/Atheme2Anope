A PHP Based Database Conversion Tool - WIP!


Usage:
 Place in folder with your Atheme Database.
 Name the database atheme.db then run
 'php convert.php' to produce an Anope Database
 named anope.db
 
 Currently this tool assumes you use posix style encryption in atheme.
 
 Use the provided enc_posix.cpp as a module in anope and load it to be able to identify.  (Its used just like any other enc type/mod in Anope2)
